# मराठी वाचवा

मराठी भाषेवर इंग्रजी भाषेचा सतत वाढत असलेल्या प्रभावला नियंत्रित करायला मी हा प्रकल्प चालू केला आहे.

उद्देश आहे की **मराठी भाषेचा वापर अशा स्वरूपात पुनरुज्जीवित करायचा ज्यात इंग्रजी शब्दांचा प्रयोग शक्य टिकत टाळता येईल
व शक्य झाल्यास पूर्णपणे काढून टाकता येईल.**

### थोडक्यात

मी शहरांमध्ये मराठीच्या ढासळत्या गुणवत्तेबद्दल लोकांना जाणीव करून देण्याचा प्रयत्न करीत आहे आणि त्यास सामोरे जाण्यासाठी काही संसाधने आणि उपाय प्रदान करीत आहे.
२ मुख्य समस्या आहेत ते म्हणजे - "**मराठी बोलताना व लिहिताना इंग्रजी शब्दांचा नकळत व खूप प्रमाणात प्रयोग**" आणि "**देवनागरी ऐवजी लॅटिन (इंग्रजी) लिपी वापरून मराठी लिहिणे**".

आत्तापर्यंत पहिल्या समस्येशी संबंधित मदत करण्यासाठी, आम्ही एक उपप्रकल्प [मराठी शब्द](https://mukta-strot.github.io/marathi-shabd/) स्थापित केला आहे ज्यामध्ये जाहिरातमुक्त इंग्रजी ते मराठी कोश आहे.

ह्या प्रकल्पात मदत होण्या साठी व्हिडीओ, ब्लॉग, लेख, सॉफ्टवेअर साधने (जसे हे संकेतस्थळ) इत्यादी यांच्या उपयोग करायचा विचार आहे.

# मराठी वाचवा (Save the Marathi language)

## About

This project is being developed as an effort to help prevent the evergrowing
influence of the English language on the Marathi language.
The objective is to **revive the usage of Marathi language in a form that is
free from (or has minimal usage of) the English language**.

### TLDR

I am trying to make people realise about the deteriorating quality of Marathi
in cities and providing some resources and solutions to tackle it. The two main
problems are "excessive use of English vocabulary in Marathi" and "writing Marathi using
Latin alphabet instead of Devanagari".

As of now, we have a sub project [मराठी शब्द](https://mukta-strot.github.io/marathi-shabd/)
in place which is an ad free English to Marathi thesaurus, to help with the
first problem.

I plan to do this with a combination of videos, blogs. articles etc. and software tools
such as this.

## Problem #1

### Excessive, unnecessary and unknowing use of English words in Marathi sentences.

When speaking or writing in Marathi we often, **unknowingly** and
**unnecessarily** use a **lot of English words**.
Though this is a natural way for a language to evolve (by using loanwords), the 
way in which it is currently happening is severly impacting the Marathi language.
Some of the reasons, in my opinion, being -

- most of the English words are not adding to any missing gaps in the Marathi 
vocabulary, but instead replacing existing words. 
The Marathi language (like all other Indian languages) already has an extremely
vast, diverse and beautiful vocabulary.
- with every next generation of Maharashtrians, the knowledge of Marathi
  vocabulary is reducing and it may have reduced drastically in the past few decades.
- as the reach of English medium schools and the internet widens, this phenomena
  will continue to grow even to rural areas. Even today's TV serials, web
series, Youtube channels etc. have an extremely Englishised version of Marathi.
- and last, but not the least, we all don't even realise that this is happening.
  Which means that no one is taking any corrective action on it, and this
problem continues to grow like an avalanche.

[**Listen to this speech**](https://youtu.be/Jg7UUU8R_Dc) to better understand what I want to say.
Below is an excellent example taken from the same.

**Fresh vegetable आणून त्यांना boil करा, मग त्यांना mash करून त्याचं dough बनवा. मग त्याला cut करून deep fry करा.**

8 out of the 20 words (40%) are in English! And most of us urban folk speak like
this, without even realising it.

## Solution

### Reduce the use of English words when communicating in Marathi.

Below is a simple way in which you can improve your usage of Marathi and at the
same time help others in doing the same. To make this a success, it will need a
**collective effort** from all of us. Also I think that **teaching children** about
this is extremely important and beneficial to this cause, as they can take
this in without any bias or prejudice and also influence their peers.


1. From now on whenever you speak (or write) in Marathi, try to observe the amount of English
you use in it (like in the example above).
2. Then try to correct youself. Use the below website (or any website/source you like) to help
   you find the right Marathi words.
  - [**मराठी शब्द (English to Marathi thesaurus without ads)**](https://mukta-strot.github.io/marathi-shabd/)
3. Ask your family, friends, relatives to do the same.
4. Lastly, do share this page with others on social media and messaging apps.

**Some tips from personal experience**

- I admit that even when I started doing this, there were certain obstacles
that I faced. Such as some words felt weird to use or people gave funny reactions etc.
But trust me, this is all momentary. All the weirdness is simply due to we not
be used to use our mother tongue proficiently. (As a side note, what can be worse
that people laughing and feeling weird about their own language. Sigh!)
- Also don't go full on from 40% English to 0% English in one day, as that can
surprise (and may be scare) some people. Instead go gradually, replacing a few 
words daily. This will make it feel more natural to you as well as the people around you.
- Stand your ground if people try to discourage or ridicule you.


## Problem #2

### Typing/writing Marathi using the Latin alphabet instead of Devanagari. 

Do you write Marathi like this when chatting with your friends or posting
on the internet -

**aaj me ghari ushira yein.**

instead of writing it correctly like this -

**आज मी घरी उशिरा येईन.**

Honestly this was a genuine problem due to technical limitations 
till about 7-8 years ago when we didn't have transliteration keyboards for
Indian languages. But today we have those on all platforms be it mobile 
or computers. However it continues to exist as people seem to be
reluctant to let go of their habit of typing using Latin (English) alphabet.

## Solution

The solution is pretty simple for this - **start using Indic keyboards**.

- Easiest way is to use a transliteration keyboard. That lets you type in
  English (which lets assume you are used to) but outputs the words in
Devanagari script. So basically you type "*namaskar*" to get "नमस्कार"
- These kind of keyboards are available on all platforms like Android, iOS,
  Windows, Mac and GNU/Linux with some slight variations. The most popular one
  on mobile is **GBoard** from Google, I think.
- On computers you can also use Google translate to do transliteration typing.
- Another way, with a steep learning curve but more efficiency (especially if you
  type long texts), is to use an InScript keyboard.

*I will write a detailed post on keyboards later when I can get time.*
