## About

This project is being developed as an effort to help prevent the evergrowing
influence of the English language on the Marathi language.

Read more at the website above.

### TLDR

I am trying to make people realise about the deteriorating quality of Marathi
in cities and providing some resources and solutions to tackle it. The two main
problems are "excessive use of English vocabulary in Marathi" and "writing Marathi using
Latin alphabet instead of Devanagari".

As of now, we have a sub project [मराठी शब्द](https://mukta-strot.github.io/marathi-shabd/)
in place which is an ad free English to Marathi thesaurus, to help with the
first problem.

I plan to do this with a combination of videos, blogs. articles etc. and software tools
such as this.
